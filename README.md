# GrowthCharacteristicsR
Graduate school publication comparing growth characteristics across juvenile conifer types, height classes, and site environmental factors. 

Juvenile (seedling and young sapling) tree survival most strongly controls forest and woodland persistence in the southwestern United States (SWUS) because they are most vulnerable to die from deleterious climatic conditions and landscape characteristics.

We developed a novel data set for four juvenile conifer groups (junipers, piñon pines, ponderosa pines, firs; 1121 juveniles sampled, 221 destructively) in three height classes (<150 mm, 150–300 mm, and 300+ mm), across 25 SWUS sites to determine how juvenile conifers partition above- and belowground growth and if growth characteristics differ between species, ecosystem types, and landscape environmental factors.

-> Use of R (for loops, regression analysis, correlation matrices, statistical analysis, data visualization) for all project components.
